# 🛡️ ISO 27001:2022 Self-Implemented ISMS Project

This repository showcases a **self-initiated implementation of ISO/IEC 27001:2022**, simulating the complete development of an Information Security Management System (ISMS) for a fictional organization. The project demonstrates hands-on knowledge in implementing ISMS controls, risk assessments, internal audits, and key information security policies.

---

## 🎯 Project Objective

To design and document an end-to-end Information Security Management System (ISMS) aligned with ISO 27001:2022, covering core clauses, Annex A controls, essential security policies, and audit readiness—developed independently for learning, demonstration, and portfolio purposes.
